## Description

JavaScript is powerful: we're able to take user interaction and information and use it to update the page without requiring a refresh.

This week, a new startup in your city, CitiPix, is looking to create a personalized picture app that allows users to store pictures they've taken around the world and quickly access them by typing in keywords or tags associated with each photo; they have asked for your help to start building the front-end prototype.

You will begin by building a web-app that will take a user's input and update the background image of the page based on that input. Once again, you have been given the starter code that includes the HTML and the CSS.

Use the images in the [images folder](starter-code/images) and write JavaScript to make the background image reflect user input based on the Technical Requirements below.

## Real-World Applications

- Write pseudocode before coding to demonstrate understanding of interactive programming theory and focus on the logic without being distracted by details of syntax
- Write JavaScript code that will update a web-page based on user interaction
- Store user-submitted information in a variable to be used throughout an application
- Clean the data you get from the page (think about .trim and .toLowerCase to make things easier)
- Change DOM elements on the page based on user input
- Specify the order in which your application runs using control flow
- Revisit applications and code you've written to find solutions to problems you've already solved

- If a user submits:
  - "New York" or "New York City" or "NYC" make the background of the page nyc.jpg
  - "San Francisco" or "SF" or "Bay Area" make the background of the page sf.jpg
  - "Los Angeles" or "LA" or "LAX" make the background of the page la.jpg
  - "Austin" or "ATX" make the background of the page austin.jpg
  - "Sydney" or "SYD" make the background of the page sydney.jpg
